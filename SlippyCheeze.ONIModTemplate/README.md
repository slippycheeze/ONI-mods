This is a "dotnet" template, usable also in Visual Studio 2022, for a new mod
inside my infrastructure.  Since almost everything is automated, all it does is
ensures that the ModName and ModDescription fields are filled out, and generates
a `csproj` file suitable for building a mod.

No code is generated by this template, which is how I like it.


To use it, build this project, and then:

```
# if previously installed, because you can't "update" without a repo
dotnet new uninstall SlippyCheeze.ONIModTemplate
# make the template available
dotnet new install .\nuget\SlippyCheeze.ONIModTemplate.1.0.0.nupkg
```
