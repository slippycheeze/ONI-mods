# SlippyCheeze Oxygen Not Included Mods

These are my personal mods for ONI (Oxygen Not Included), a game by Klei, many
of which are made public as a way of giving **something** back to the community.

## Building the Mods

1. Copy `Directory.Build.props.default` to `Directory.Build.props.user`
2. Edit the content to match your system, notably the paths.
3. Open the SLN in Visual Studio 2022, and Build All

There shouldn't be any need to do anything else, and building any file in any
mod should rebuild all the depndencies including from the game, etc.

## Steam Workshop

I'm presently not putting my mods on the Steam Workshop, or producing binary
releases, because they are very much focused on my needs â€” and while I'm happy
if others want to use them, I'm not a good long term maintainer for game mods.

However, they are MIT licensed where possible, so you should be able to use any
of them with relative freedom if you want to do that yourself.  Just ensure you
comply with the terms of the license and all that.
